Files to test your unshadow skills

I found these files online at https://github.com/amaldeeps7 so kuddo's to AMAL.

These files can be used by you to learn to combine the passwd file and the shadow file so you can feed the outcome to john the ripper and creak the passwords.

Use the default rockyou.txt file to test your unshadow file with.

I tried it myself and it works on Parrot OS.

Check the cmd.txt for the commands I used. to unshadow this file and feed it to johnny.
