Working on Parrot OS these are the commands that worked for me.

sudo /usr/bin/unshadow /path/to/training-passwd.txt /path/to/training-shadow.txt > /home/parrot/unshadow.db
This will create the unshadow file to feed to johnny.

Open johnny and click "open password file" using the PASSWD format.
On the Options page select Wordlist and click Browse for the default rockyou.txt list.
